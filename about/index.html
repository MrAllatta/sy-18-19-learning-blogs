title: About Me
---

My name is Eric Allatta. My students call me Mr. Allatta. I have been a teacher at the Academy for Software Engineering since it opened at 2012. In the summers my family and I like to visit Santa Fe, NM where we used to live and where my daughter was born. 

While my children go to outdoor camp, I work with the guitar maker who I met in 2007, and who we have stayed with every year since. One of my favorite thing to do there is to use data to help refine the workflow and organization of the shop.
