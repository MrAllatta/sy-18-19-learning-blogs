We often say in our computer science class that sometimes we are "name matchers" and sometimes we are "name creators"; it's important for us to know the difference and to know which hat we are wearing. At the beginning of the school year we were 95% name matchers. We followed a guide to create a blog page and we learned the importance of matching names perfectly. Names are recognized by computers because they can match what we type to what they already know.

Names also set up expectations. The name of a function calls up what the function expects. In order to use names we have to know about these expectations and recognize the agreement that we share with our computer. We call the agreement between functions and programmers a contract because it describes how the function expects to be used and what we can expect in return.

Students in class this week worked on understanding different representations of functions. On one hand we can use a function that already exists by applying the name of the function to specific values. On the other hand we can define functions by describing the rule that the function will follow. Definitions delay the evaluation of a function, so when we run our programs we don't see anything until we try to use the function.

Contracts are descriptions of the inputs and outputs of a function and they can help us when we are trying to figure out the rule for the function we want to create. We may not know everything about the function, but we at least say how we expect the function to work. With a good contract we can proceed with defining the function. As we start to build more complex programs we will be glad we have our contracts to provide additional information when our programs aren't working.
