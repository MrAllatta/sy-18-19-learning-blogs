Both 9th and 10th grades are deep into functions. This is always a difficult time of the year when student face a process of developing abstraction for the first time. (Even when you've seen it before it feels like the first time.) Of course a few students understand abstraction intuitively and a challenge for the instructor is encouraging everyone else to keep working through the steps until abstraction becomes natural. I've been calling out more explicity this year the students who are chunking the concepts, but also telling the class that they don't need help; they just need to practice.

Function design is really about understanding what you are trying to do in the first place. There is some computation that you want to do over and over, and you want a tool that exposes just the part of the computation that you want to be able to change. The data that changes depends on what you want to do with it, so we try to ground the process in using data to model the real world. I've become excited about using small business as a hook for students, and this year we've gone deeper than I've done before.

Pushing students is delicate business. Many people have a fixed idea about what they are capable of doing and a fixed idea about the world they live in. My computer science course exposes students to many concepts that they've never thought about, and it can lead students to give up if they aren't rewarded along the way with small wins. I was talking to another teacher today about one of her advisees, who thinks that they aren't doing well in my class. The truth is they are doing great in a challenging subject, and need to be encouraged to keep taking steps forward.
