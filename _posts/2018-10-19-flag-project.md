Students are working toward creating programs that reproduce an intended output. One of their first experiences with this skill is the flag project. Students use the HtDP image library in either Racket or Pyret to create a collage program to accurately display the national flag of a country.

Here is an example of that flag:

![Flag of Japan](/images/JapanFlag.png)

## Racket
```scheme
(define (japan size)
  (local
    ((define width (* size 300))
     (define height (* size 200))
     (define bkg (rectangle width height "outline" "black"))
     (define dot (circle (* (/ height 2) 3/5) "solid" "red")))
    (overlay dot bkg)))
```

## Pyret
```python
include image 

fun japan(size):
  width = size * 300
  height = size * 200
  bkg = rectangle(width, height, "outline", "black")
  dot = circle((height / 2) * 3/5, "solid", "red")
  overlay(dot, bkg)
end
```
