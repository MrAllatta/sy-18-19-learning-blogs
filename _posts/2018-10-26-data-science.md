We finished the first unit of our data science module and have now seen all the styles of problem solving and creating that we will experience this school year. Data science is about using computation to explore questions about data. We began this unit by looking at questions and picking which questions were meaningful to us. Later in the year we will be able to ask these questions by defining our own functions and producing tables and visualizations to answer it.

Our first unit gave us a chance to review some basic concepts about data. We can group data into categories called types. These types help us to answer different questions and allow us to represent different kinds of information depending on how the data is used. Data can be computed by functions and operations. Data can be displayed, and new data can be produced from old data.

At the end of this mini unit students made bigger connections than they had before about the concepts we have experienced and the learning in other classes. They connected data to the structure of web pages and addresses, they connected different types of data and observed that they can be analgous: there is something simlar between adding numbers and comparing them. For many students it was a big revelation to add images to a table about images. We can represent data and properties of data and organize it in a way that allows us to access and manipulate that data. That seemed very powerful.
