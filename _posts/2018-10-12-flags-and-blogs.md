I teach two sections of 9th grade Intro to CS and two sections of 10th grade AP CS Principles. Its been several years since I have taught the full 9th grade course; I have taught an Algebra based computing elective the past few years. I have taught AP CSP for the past five years to several different grades.

This year my 9th and 10th grade courses are running parallel to each other in an attempt to align the courses as a two year sequence that both maps onto to our Algebra and Geometry curriculum and that culminates in the AP CSP course assessments.

Both courses are taught in functional programming languages: 9th grade in Racket (Scheme) and 10th grade in Pyret. Both courses have three major pillars: Algebra, Data Science, and the Internet. These themes are tied together through investigations of the structure of data.

This week both classes are learning to decompose an image and to write a program to reproduce it. National flags are a nice choice for project when getting to know the Racket and Pyret image library. Flags lend themselves to decomposition and abstraction. Racket and Pyret share a common semantics for images and so the same project can be refactored to give students confidence when they are learning something new.

A strength of the past weeks has been the focus on the health of the learning community and the reflections of learning that students publish each week.

One area for growth is that many students have not chunked the process of creating a new post file for their Jekyll blogs, so writing a post and getting it to publish is overloading their working memory. To address this we are going to set up their post file for that week at the beginning of the week, and structure time each period for writing reflections and summaries in their notes. Hopefully, when we get to Friday when learning reflections must be published, it won't be such of a heavy lift.
