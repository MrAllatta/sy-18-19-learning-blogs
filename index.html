<h1>Welcome to Mr. Allatta's Learning Blog!</h1>
<p>This will be my home base for sharing learning reflections with my students throughout the year. Much thanks to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan Mcglone</a> for the great tutorial getting us up to speed with GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>In the 2018-2019 school year my students are 9th and 10th graders at the Academy for Software Engineering. They are the "Lower Academy" of a comprehensive public high school in NYC, which is also the first comprehensive high school in the city with a core computer science sequence. The two year lower academy sequence is required of all students and culminates in the AP Computer Science Principles exam.</p>
